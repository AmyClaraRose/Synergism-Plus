# Synergism Plus

## Modding
### Getting Started
Welcome to Synergism Plus! Here's a quick and easy to understand guide on how to get started making your own mod!<br>
To start simply `fork` this Repository and clone it to your local machine.<br>
Once you've done that open it up in your code editor of choice (preferably Visual Studio Code) and open up the Terminal.<br>
Once you've opened the Terminal run `npm install` to install all dependencies. This is very important, the project will not work without it! <br>
If you've completed all these steps you're ready to move on to the next section!

### Adding a new Mod Toggle
Congrats on completing the first section! This section will walk you through creating the Mod Toggle for your Mod!<br>
Let's start by adding it to `index.html`<br>
Head over to `index.html` line `2986`. This line begins the section of `index.html` that contains all the content in the Modifications tab.<br>
You should see a block of code that looks something like this: ![img.png](img.png)<br> 
You're going to want to copy that entire code block and paste it beneath the last block of its type (so, if there were 3 blocks like that you'd paste it beneath the 3rd).<br>
This is your Mod's toggle code! You'll want to start by replacing the text in the `<span>` element with the name of your Mod.<br>
We're going to be making a few changes to the `button` element. First, replace the `id` with `toggle<your Mod's Toggle Number here>`. Then replace the `toggleid` with `<your Mod's Toggle Number here>`<br>
Don't know what your Mod's Toggle Number is? That's ok, we'll be going over that in the next section :)<br>
Congratulations! You've successfully created your Mod's Toggle! Head over to the next section to learn how to give its own Toggle Number and make it a functional toggle!
Oh, and don't forget to add your Mod and a short description of it to the Mods List!

### Creating a Toggle Number and making the Toggle functional
You've almost finished setting up your Mod's Toggle! Read through this section to learn how to create a Toggle Number for your Mod and how to make the Toggle functional!<br>
Ok, this is where things get a bit more complex. Let's start by heading over to line `378` of `UpdateHTML.ts`.<br>
There you should see a list of Toggle Numbers with a comment next to them. You'll want to copy that line and paste it beneath the other Toggle Numbers.<br>
From there, change the number in its name to the previous Toggle Number's plus one (so, if the previous Toggle was named `"toggle35"` you'd name yours `"toggle36"`) and change the comment to say `//Settings - Mods - <your Mod's name here> Toggle`<br>
Now head over to `Synergism.ts` line `269`. There you should see a array of all the Toggle Numbers. Simply add your Toggle Number to the bottom of the array!<br>
Last but not least head over to `EventListeners.ts` line `191`. There you should see a `for` loop. Simply change the second number in the `for` loop to whatever it was plus one (so, if it was a 35 you'd change it to a 36)!<br>
Congratulations! You've now created a fully functional Mod Toggle! If you didn't already, go back to your code block in `index.html` and fill in your Toggle Numbers.

### Running your Mod locally
Running your Mod locally only takes 3 simple steps!<br>
1. Open up `index.html` in your browser of choice.
2. Go back to your code editor, open the terminal and run `npm run build:esbuild`.
3. Go back to your browser and refresh the page.

Your Mod should now be running locally! If you make a update to your Mod but still have the page open simply repeat steps 2 and 3 to see all your new changes.

### Coding your Mod
This is the part where I have to leave you to your own devices.<br>
From here you can venture into the code and modify whatever you please, just be careful to fix any errors that you may cause!<br>
Important: Make sure whatever effect your Mod has only runs when the toggle is enabled. Thanks :)<br>
You can check if your Mod is toggled by using a simple if statment: `if(player.toggles[your Toggle Number])`<br>
Have fun!

### Adding your Mod to Synergism Plus
Are you finished with your Mod and ready to share it with the world? Here's a simple guide on how to do that!<br>
First, be sure there are no errors. No Mods that cause errors will be added, sorry.<br>
Then simply create a PR (pull request) to the Synergism Plus repo, I'll merge it as soon as I see it! Once I do your Mod will be on the main site!
